# Square Snowflake

## Setup

The dependencies are [gl-matrix](https://github.com/toji/gl-matrix), matrix and vector javascript library, along with the [qunit](http://qunitjs.com), unit testing framework. To avoid downloading these packages manually, the command

    bower install

will fetch the required libraries and place them into the *components* folder at the root directory. The [bower](http://bower.io) command requires [node.js](http://nodejs.org) to be installed.

    npm install bower

will download the package.

## Viewing

To check how the template is rendering simply navigate to the index file in the root directory with any browser that has WebGL support. Alternatively, check out the [project site](http://eugenekadish.github.io/scene-template/) to compare the widget. The tests can be run in the browser as well, by opening *runner.html* in *tests*.

# Square Snowflake

Drawing of a recursively defined Sierpinski fractal curve using SVG.

## Setup

The only dependency is [qunit](http://qunitjs.com); for running the unit tests. To avoid downloading these package manually, the command

    bower install

will fetch the required libraries and place them into the *components* folder at the root directory. The [bower](http://bower.io) command requires [node.js](http://nodejs.org) to be installed.

    npm install bower

will download the package.

## Viewing

To see the running application navigate to the index file in the root directory, or checkout out the [project site](http://eugenekadish.github.io/square-snowflake). The tests can be run in the browser as well, by opening *runner.html* in *tests*.
